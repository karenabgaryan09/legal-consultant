                            Know-how is and always has been the most valuable asset of any business. What did
                            you do to protect it from unauthorized access? Do you have sufficient safeguards
                            in place to mitigate the risk posed by corporate espionage and unfair competition?
                            <br />
                            In order to promote responsible business operation, a company must make sure that
                            its privacy policies, data protection rulebooks, and non-disclosure agreements are
                            well-drafted and implemented. By employing legal safeguards and enforcing them
                            diligently, you can successfully shield your company from these potential threats.
