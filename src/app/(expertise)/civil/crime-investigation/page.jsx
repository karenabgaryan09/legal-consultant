                        <p>
                            Our lawyers are confident and assertive in criminal defense before courts. We
                            approach every case with the same mindset - to obtain the best possible outcome
                            for the client. Our main strategy is to sway the public prosecutor and not let the
                            case go to the court. Our clients can expect prompt response in emergency.
                            <br />
                            We provide legal support before public prosecutor and court in criminal matters:
