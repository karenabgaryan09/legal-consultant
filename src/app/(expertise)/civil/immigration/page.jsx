                            If you find yourself in a situation where you need to recover a debt from an
                            individual or a company in Serbia, our lawyers are ready to assist you in pursuing
                            the necessary legal actions before competent institutions.
                            <br />
                            In case you have obtained a favorable decision in a foreign country, our lawyers
                            can guide you through the process of enforcing that decision in Serbia. Delivery
                            of a foreign decision proved to be quite elusive in Serbia, so you may need
                            on-site assistance of an experienced lawyer.
