                            We understand that employment termination can be a non- pleasant procedure, and by
                            entrusting us with this responsibility, employers can focus on their core business
                            operations. We handle employee notification, discussion and termination swiftly
                            and effectively. We also advise on disciplinary measures toward employees to
                            eliminate any risk for the employer.
